## Narrative
The artifact that was enhanced for this milestone was originally a Python web application concept for Grazioso Salvare. Grazioso Salvare was a mock company that needed a web application to read and filter data from their database. This artifact was originally created in February of 2024 while taking CS 340 Client Server Development at Southern New Hampshire University. 

The enhancement I performed on this artifact was transferring the project to Java, using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack framework and integrating a RESTful API. I chose to include this project in my ePortfolio for several reasons. For one, this kind of project demonstrates a wide variety of my skills as a computer scientist. For example, experience working with powerful languages and frameworks, and the ability to design and develop scalable and easily maintainable software. This project is also a good concept for kickstarting my career as a software engineer. Since the project provides a concept application that is frequently used and required for many companies to operate, it would be an attractive piece for gaining attention from smaller companies looking to develop a similar web application. I value this attention from smaller companies as it provides great potential for allowing me to get a footing in the computer science field and gain experience. Additionally, this project would aid me in achieving proficiency in two of the course outcomes; employing strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science, and demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database). 

This enhancement was my first time ever transferring a project from one programming language to another. This process was a great learning experience, helping me to learn some of the strengths and weaknesses of the different languages used in the project. For example, it was much easier to connect to and communicate with the database, as well as build the data table in Python. However, Java provides better scalability and reusability and allows for easily developing both a client-facing web application and an administrative web application. One challenge I faced was trying to recreate the functionality of the data table in Java. The Python version used a module that made it easy to provide filtering and sorting options for the data table. This was more difficult to accomplish in Java and took more time to do than when working with Python. Overall, this was a great experience for me and will provide a great artifact for my ePortfolio.

## Narrative
The artifact that was enhanced for this milestone was originally a mock application for Grand Strand Systems. The application had three classes, Appointment, Contact, and Task, which each had their own service classes. These classes provided functionality for adding, updating, and removing the respective items from their service class's list. This application's main purpose was to show my ability to thoroughly test the application with unit testing. This artifact was originally created in November of 2023 while taking CS 320 Test Automation & Quality Assurance at Southern New Hampshire University. 

The enhancement I performed on this artifact was implementing several algorithms and data structures into each of the classes mentioned. In the AppointmentService class, I implemented a Quicksort algorithm and a binary search algorithm to improve lookup performance. In the ContactService class, I implemented a HashMap to improve performance when inserting, deleting, updating, and accessing the contact list. In the TaskService class, I implemented a priority queue combined with a HashMap to allow for accessing tasks based on their priority. The inclusion of this artifact allowed me to showcase multiple skills. First, this artifact allowed me to demonstrate proficiency with multiple algorithms and data structures. This highlights my ability to use varied approaches to improve the functionality and performance of software. Additionally, this specific artifact allowed me to demonstrate my testing abilities. In this artifact, I demonstrate familiarity with both unit testing and performance testing. Testing is an essential skill for a developer to have, thus was another motivator for choosing this artifact. This artifact also allowed me to achieve proficiency in the following course outcome: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. 

Enhancing this artifact provided me with more experience working with more complicated algorithms and data structures. While I have worked with most of these algorithms and data structures in the past, this project was a good way of refamiliarizing myself with these concepts. This enhancement also allowed me to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms and data structures used which I was previously unaware of. I also gained experience performing performance testing on the software. Performance testing is a great skill to learn as it can be very helpful for measuring and improving the efficiency of programs. This enhancement was another great experience and will provide another great artifact for my ePortfolio.
