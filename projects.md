# Travelr Getaways

## Overview
Developed a concept full-stack web application for a mock company Travelr Getaways, showcasing my skills in modern web development technologies. This web application leverages the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack framework and integrates a RESTful API to provide robust and efficient functionalities for both customers and administrators.

The client-facing portion of the application is designed to be dynamic and user-friendly, built using Express and JavaScript. It features a multi-page front-end that allows customers to seamlessly navigate through various sections of the website and book trips with ease. This part of the application demonstrates my ability to create responsive and interactive web pages that enhance the user experience.

The administrative interface is a single-page application (SPA) developed with Angular, providing administrators with the tools to manage trip information effectively. Administrators can add, edit, and delete trip entries in the database, ensuring that the content remains current and accurate. This SPA also implements authentication using JSON Web Tokens to secure the application and prevent unauthorized access, highlighting my understanding of security practices in web development.

## Narrative
The artifact that was enhanced for this milestone was originally a mock application for Grand Strand Systems. The application had three classes, Appointment, Contact, and Task, which each had their own service classes. These classes provided functionality for adding, updating, and removing the respective items from their service class's list. This application's main purpose was to show my ability to thoroughly test the application with unit testing. This artifact was originally created in November of 2023 while taking CS 320 Test Automation & Quality Assurance at Southern New Hampshire University. 

The enhancement I performed on this artifact was implementing several algorithms and data structures into each of the classes mentioned. In the AppointmentService class, I implemented a Quicksort algorithm and a binary search algorithm to improve lookup performance. In the ContactService class, I implemented a HashMap to improve performance when inserting, deleting, updating, and accessing the contact list. In the TaskService class, I implemented a priority queue combined with a HashMap to allow for accessing tasks based on their priority. The inclusion of this artifact allowed me to showcase multiple skills. First, this artifact allowed me to demonstrate proficiency with multiple algorithms and data structures. This highlights my ability to use varied approaches to improve the functionality and performance of software. Additionally, this specific artifact allowed me to demonstrate my testing abilities. In this artifact, I demonstrate familiarity with both unit testing and performance testing. Testing is an essential skill for a developer to have, thus was another motivator for choosing this artifact. This artifact also allowed me to achieve proficiency in the following course outcome: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. 

Enhancing this artifact provided me with more experience working with more complicated algorithms and data structures. While I have worked with most of these algorithms and data structures in the past, this project was a good way of refamiliarizing myself with these concepts. This enhancement also allowed me to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms and data structures used which I was previously unaware of. I also gained experience performing performance testing on the software. Performance testing is a great skill to learn as it can be very helpful for measuring and improving the efficiency of programs.

## Narrative
The artifact enhanced for this milestone is the same one enhanced in the software engineering section. That artifact was a web application that populated a database using a CSV file and then read and filtered data from it. 

The enhancements I performed in this milestone were adding operations for updating and deleting entries in the database, adding indexes to improve database performance, and implementing a system for authentication. I chose to build off the first milestone’s enhancement since that project lends itself well to further demonstrating my abilities with databases. I also wanted to build a larger single project that more comprehensively demonstrates my skills as a developer. The enhancements picked for this milestone were intentional to demonstrate some particular skills. I wanted to add functionality to update and delete elements from the database via the web application to demonstrate my ability to consider how customers will use the applications I develop. I chose to add indexes to the database to show my consideration for improving an application’s performance. Finally, I wanted to implement authentication to show my anticipation for potential misuse, displaying a value for security. Doing so allowed me to achieve my final course outcome of developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. 

While enhancing this artifact, I learned how to improve database performance, consider user needs, and develop a security mindset. While these were not new skills I learned entirely, these artifacts allowed me to develop these skills further. A challenge I faced while performing this enhancement was applying authentication to the application. The challenges I faced were due to changes in the way the frameworks used interact with one another throughout updates to these frameworks. This is a common challenge developers will face as they maintain their codebase. Frameworks and APIs will sometimes receive updates that change how they are used requiring developers to make necessary changes when upgrading versions. Thus, this challenge proved to be a valuable experience gained from performing this enhancement.
