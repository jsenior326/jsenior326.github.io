## Overview
Developed a concept full-stack web application for a mock company Travelr Getaways, showcasing my skills in modern web development technologies. This web application leverages the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack framework and integrates a RESTful API to provide robust and efficient functionalities for both customers and administrators.

The client-facing portion of the application is designed to be dynamic and user-friendly, built using Express and JavaScript. It features a multi-page front-end that allows customers to seamlessly navigate through various sections of the website and book trips with ease. This part of the application demonstrates my ability to create responsive and interactive web pages that enhance the user experience.

The administrative interface is a single-page application (SPA) developed with Angular, providing administrators with the tools to manage trip information effectively. Administrators can add, edit, and delete trip entries in the database, ensuring that the content remains current and accurate. This SPA also implements authentication using JSON Web Tokens to secure the application and prevent unauthorized access, highlighting my understanding of security practices in web development.

<b>Technologies Used:<b/> MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js, MongoDB Compass, Postman, REST, JSON, JavaScript, Git
